fuck poetry arranged inconvenient bicycle corrected spelling Fall in Love with English Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain a teenager packed up his overcoat into the suitcase He planned to leave home at dusk though there was thunder and lightning outdoors He had got to do this because he was tired of hsi parents nagging about his English study and did not want to go through it any longer He couldn t get along well with English and disliked joining in English classesbecausehe thought his teacher ignored him on purpose As a result his score in each exam never added up to over His partner was concerned about him very much She understood exactly what he was suffering from but entirely disagreed with his idea In order to calm him down and settle his problem she talked with him face to face and swapped a series of learning tips with him The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend s words Now h has recovered from being upset and has fallen in love with English Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes Voyages of people from England play an important part in spreading the English language At present English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries such as America Singapore Malaysia and some African countries All based on British English the English spoken in these countries can be well understood by native English speakers But actually these Englishes have been gradually changing in accents spellings expressions and the usage of vocabulary Because of this fact you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreigners of your block are from For example if a boss fluently commands his driver Comeup straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs instead of requesting Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis you can recognize his American idelenttihtye whi latter suggests that he is British Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis elevator lift A Hard Trip My sister was fond of traveling Ever since graduating she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple Since transporting fare was expensive she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about the disadvantages Her stubborn attitude was always her shortcoming Once she made up her mind to do something no one could persuade her to change her mind Finally we gave in as usual though we preferred to take a train After we prepared everything including the schedule reliable weather forecast and the insurance we began our trip Our journey was along a river flowing from a high altitude Our pace was slow because the river frequently had many sharp bends through deep valleys where the water seemed to boil Just as I recorded in my journal it was really a hard journey But we also enjoyed great views One night I put my head on my pillow a parcel of wool coats and lay beneath the stars When the flame in front of our cave went out at midnight I found the sky so beautiful A Horrible Earthquake Dirty water rose in wells and canals before the earthquake But no one judged that an earthquake was coming Suddenly everything shook It seemed as if the world was at an end Millions of brick houses and a number of dams were destroyed Railway tracks became uselessbars Pipes in mines burst and let out smelly steam Huge cracks trapped cyclists everywhere The next day this event was the headline or main title of all newspapers With the reporters giving an outline of the disaster the whole nation was shocked by the damage and the victim x tresmee suffering People were moved when they read that the survivors comforted each other by saying Congratulations You survived So they not only expressed their sympathy sincerely but also organized together to help the victims right away The injured were rescued and the dead were buried The frightened survivors were dug out from under the ruins and were offered shelter fresh water and electricity Thanks to people s help the loss was minimized The Great President As the founder of the republic the president had many good qualities Before coming to power he was a generous lawyer He was willing to selflessly help everyone who turned to him He accepted no fee to offer legal guidance and opinions to those who were out of work or uneducated Later believing all mankind to be equal he devoted himself to stopping the unfair anti black laws He set up the Black Youth League and was voted to be the leader However though he kept peaceful principles without violence and terror his mean enemies still blew up his house and attacked his relatives and he himself ass couldn t escape being sentenced to years in prison Not fearing of the prison guards cru elty he kept active and begged no mercy from them As a matter of fact he was always hopeful and never lost heart during the stage even though he was in trouble Finally people rewarded him with the leader s position and a gold blanket A Brave Maid A wooden vase from the Ming Dynasty at the entrance of the reception hall amazed everyone The artists designed it in a rare style and selected valuable jewels to decorate it People thought highly of its fancy color of honey and the beautiful paintings on it The vase used to belong to a former castle But when the country was at war the enemy troops exploded the castle Debates on how the vase survived went on and on In order to remove people dosubt a team of no less than people carried out an informal investigation The evidences they found showed that a maid took the vase apart and asked a sailor to sink it in a local well She never gave away the secret even under the cruel trial of the enemies who were in search of treasures It is worth giving this brave maid a fortune in return A Fair Competition Swifter Higher and Stronger stands for the spirit of the Olympics But fairness is the basis of this motto Only when you win fairly will you and your homeland deserve the great glory But nowadays unlike the ancient honest slave competitors some hopeless athletes who can t bear the pain of training cheat when taking part in games Medals seem to have magical power causing them to cheat and the prize money has replaced the motto as their only goal So in the gymnastics event to be held in our city next month one of the host responsibilities is to keep competitions fair They advertised on posters outside the stadium to promise that every competitor is to have a regular physical examination in a gymnasium one after another No one can bargain on this The volunteers in charge will be very strict It is foolish to cheat because they will not be admitted to compete and will even be fined as well Computers The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums But with the help of new technology electronic chips replaced tubes and a revolution of artificial intelligence has arisen From then on the appearanceof computers totally changed our lives They can not only download information from the wet when connected by the network or mobile phone signals but also solve different types of logical problems With operators as their coaches they can even control rockets to explore the moon and instruct androids with the human race s characterms otop floors and watch over your naughty niece Anyhow computers are so helpful that they do bring happiness However computers are easily attacked by viruses This reality has become a hard to deal with problem As a result computers are dangerous in a way So personally I worry about their universal applications in some fields such as finance Wildlife Protection Dinosaurs died out because of an unexpected incident But wildlife today disappears or is in danger just because humans do harm to it For example tigers are hunted for fur to make carpets so that they can only live in secure reserves grassland is destroyed without mercy so that dust storms come into being affecting distant cities Last year scientists saw some monkeys rubbing themselves with a certain kind of insects to protect themselves from fierce mosquitoes biting According to the result of the inspection they found that the insect contains a powerful drug so local farmers were employed to catch the insects The ending was that the insects disappeared from the whole zone When told that it was a loss to humans the farmers burst into laughter and responded Our real loss is our decreasing income We should appreciate the natural balance and pay more attention to the importance of wildlife protection Not until we succeed in letting wildlife live in peace can we smile in relief My First Band I was very sensitive to music Just dipping into the music books briefly I could sing or play well To be honest I always dreamt of becoming a famous folk actor I was so confident that I never decreased my devotion I formed my first band called RollingFrog A t the beginning we relied on performing on instruments in pubs or to passers by to earn extra money in cash Then we wore false beards to pretend to be the musicians whom people were familiar with In addition we attached humorous acts to our performances and played jokes on each other Soon our funnyjazz b ecame famous and invitations to perform for broadcast stations began to come Afterwards we sorted out attractive music and made a record in a studio A million or so copies were sold and we became millionaires It was painful that the band broke up finally But above all I realized my dream to be a musician An Interesting Festival The Agricultural Feast takes place after the Independence Day It is not a worldwide celebration Only Christians in Mexico look forward to its arrival for its religious origin Long ago humans ancestors were bad They fooled and played tricks on each other and never kept their word So God turned up and drowned all their crops Humans starved day and night weeping In order to gain God s forgiveness a woman poet set off to see God She admired God and kept apologizing God was moved With his permission humans finally had good harvests again So to wipe sadnessand remind themselves of the belief in God people began the festival On the festival people gather in open air such as playgrounds or parking lots and energetically have fun with each other all night long as though they were never tired When a beauty dressed up in lovely clothing reads poems in memory of the poet everyone holds their breath Then it is the custom that the bone of a rooster head is given to her as an award Obviously the story is not true but the festival is interesting Balanced Diet Wang Peng earned his living by running a barbecue restaurant which served delicious bacon fried chicken breast and mutton roasted with pepper and garlic But his food and discount attracted fewer and fewer customers Finally he was in debt Yong Hui sslimming restaurant served fresh peas carrots eggplants and raw cucumbers with vinegar As the hostess she said fibres benefited customers digestion the most In order not to let Yong Hui get away with telling lies Wang Peng spied on Yong Hui despite her glare But he was surprised that she was losing her customers too Curiosity drove Wang Peng to consult an expert The expert sighed and said Bothof your menus have weakness and limited strength Your customers put on weight too easily while Yong Hui s lose weight too quickly So Wang Peng cut down the fat of your food and increase vegetables and fruits like nuts beans mushrooms peachesand peach lemons You ought to combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet Before long Wang Peng won his customers back Sailing Home This novel was about an unbelievable but genuine adventure Its author was a black businessman who was brought up in America In he visited Africa his birthplace One day when he was wandering on the pavement near the bay enjoying the sea scenes he lost his money and passport that he kept in an envelope So he went to the embassy to seek help but the ambassador with rude manners didn t permit hi staff to help though he bowed to him Staring at his impatient face he understood that it was the fault of his skin colour that accounted for their refection So he decided to take a chance to sail on a small boat home He met a large amount of difficulty but was never stopped On the contrary difficulty pushed him to go ahead harder Three months later he was spotted by a ship by accident He was in rags indeed A maid even screamed when bringing him a steak and pineapple dessert Aboard he earned his passage by working as a barber and got home finally As for the name of his novel he couldn t think of a better one than the phrase Go Ahead Explore MKII MKII MKII a planet billions of kilometers away is the origin of life in many religions Physicists have proved the theory that its gentle climate and the pull of its gravity are similar to the earth Asn d astronomers have found that oxygen atoms and carbon dioxide which are fundamental to life exist in its atmosphere through satellites Cheered up by this news biologists in their turn began to do some research to remove people psuzzles Now that there are some suitable conditions does life really exist on this globe Do they multiply by laying eggs or giving birth to babies Last month a spaceship was sent there It s a pity that this mission failed Unlike the earth MKII is a much younger planet Thus masses of harmful acid clouds float everywhere causing violent chain reactions to break out These clouds not only blocked out the pilots sight but also damaged the engine system Luckily the pilots watched out carefully and prevented the spaceship from crashing in time MK MK A Journey across Canada After a quiz last autumn Kuang crossed the continent eastward to Toronto to visit his schoolmate the distance measuring approximately kilometers His train started from Vancouver a city surrounded by mountains After confirming his baggage was aboard the train Kuang settled down in his seat Having a gift for communication he started chatting with another passenger within minutes Their topics included the Canadian traditions the Prime Minister the mixture of races and the terrifying Great Fall After a nice buffet at noon he was pleased to find that the scenery was impressive He saw beautiful harbours in the distance wealthy urban areasand maple forest that covered thousands of acres He even managed to catch sight of an eagle flying upward over bushes Kuang reached Toronto which lies slightly near the border at a misty dawn There was frost and the broad downtown streets were very quiet Though it was early Kuang phoned his schoolmate in a booth nearby at once rather than waiting for him to come They had a good time together A Woman Doctor Lina Born in a pigs nest Lina led a poor life in her childhood She was looked down upon by the children of her generation But she intended to become a doctor after she came across Lin Qiaozhi by chance who was delivering medical courses to an audience crowding around her Before moving off Lin inspired her to carry on her study With Lin s support Lina entered an institute and studied hard sparing no time for entertainment Her being outspoken and modest won respect for her Her excellent arguing skills and observation ability put others into the shade Now Lina has become a specialist in human beings em ergency sickness Her kindness and considerate behavior to the poor were well known The organization she founded carried out campaigns and welfare projects to help cut the death rate for the poor Her job was hard but worthwhile She often refers to the connection between her achievement and Lin Qiaozhi and says that her poor childhood is the bond between her and the poor A New Farming Way Tuan was a farmer in Vietnam For decades he had been struggling to rid his family of hunger However it always confused him how to expand the output of his crops This disturbing problem led to his regretting being a farmer He would rather have chosen another job One day when skimming through a newspaper Tuan read a comment on Yuan Longpin He underlined Yuan s nationality and occupation and then focused on his discovery and the statistics of his research He found the knowledge Yuan circulated very practical Therefore he made a summary and began to build up a new farming method He planted super grain of rich nutrition and equipped himself to keep his crops roots free from bacteria and pests He also enriched minerals in the soil while reducing chemical fertilizers Though it cost him more time and freedom he was full of hope The next year Tuan was sunburnt but satisfied with his production very much Thanks to Yuan Longpin he not only won the battle against hunger but he could also export his crops abroad Chaplin A Great Master of Humour Chaplin was an extraordinary performer who starred in and directed many outstanding comedies Few were bored watching his moustache his gesturesor his entertaining reactions when chased by detectives Being drunk sliding on a banana skin or whispering his own failures to nobody he made us feel more content with our life without any verbal explanation His particular sense of humor has astonished everybody throughout the world up to now In a small budget film he played a badly off and homeless person wearing worn out shoes and messy clothes On one occasion he was trapped by a snowstorm in a vast mountainous area Though he overcame many difficulties he wasn t fortunate enough With all the porridge eaten up he picked out a shoe and boiled it to eat He cut off the leather bottom and chewed it like a pancake According to an actress his acting was so convincing and amusing that everybody couldn htelp bursting into laughter A Misunderstanding In general spoken statementsare the major way of communication but body language and facial expressions also have such kinds of function For example yawning means being not interested and turning one s back to someone or swinging your fist shows your anger But what those gestures really mean is subjective in different cultures Thus misunderstandings happen now and then in today s world cultural crossroads Once representing the Adults Ed ucation Association I went to the airport to meet an official of high rank from Columbia and take him to his dormitory and then to the canteen After the flight arrived I saw a man looking around curiously So I approached to greet him He suddenly dashed to hug me and kissed me on both cheeks As a young girl I felt truly embarrassedand put up my hands to defend myself His false smile told me that he had lost face Later I received a cassettefrom him in which he recorded his apology On hearing that Columbians were more likely to kiss others I soon felt at ease A Unique Theme Park As soon as our shuttle got close to the theme park by the freeway everyone came to life and put on cloth sneakers in advance for an outing Our translator paid for the admission and we started enjoying the various attractions in the sunlight According to the travel brochure this unique park is famous for its well preserved minority culture We experienced many deeds of the early settlers such as swinging across rivers hunting creatures in the jungle or taking part in swords fighting tournaments This park is also famous for its wooden souvenirs Whichever we bought in the central shop was made of wood and wherever we went we could see minority carpenters working They made wooden tools wooden cartoon figures wooden athletic products and so on They even built a huge wooden engine with a length of metres which was modeled after a real one This theme park is really a fantasy amusement park No wonder it has become the brand of local tourism A Strange Disease When the construction of the firework factory came to the stage of painting a pump was put in Then all the painters in the neighbourhood were defeated by a severe disease whose characteristic was alike to that of a bad burn An expert physician was instructed to attend to the victims and handle this case He was enthusiastic but he didn t foresee that it was a hard challenge After simple enquiry he announced that the polluted paint was to blame But without positive evidence people suspectedand rejected his view saying the theory he put forward made no sense Being much more strict with himself he contributed himself to the case Apart from making enquiries he made detailed charts and analysed the data cautiously Finally he drew a scientific conclusion linking the disease to the radium in the pump Exposed to radium a kind of radioactive material in the universe people absorbed radiation and got sick immediately Spinning the pump backward he took away the radium This simple movement cured all the victims Sightseeing in the United Kingdom After the wedding my cousin and his wife went to the United Kingdom for nationwide sightseeing He faxed a letter to me in English yesterday To my delight he no longer made any tense error And his description roughly clarified my questions about the UK its currency its administration the institution which divides it into four provinces and the historical conflicts and quarrels when Southern Ireland broke away from the UK Unwilling to leave out any attraction my cousin arranged his enjoyable journey carefully One attractive place he visited was a castle in the countryside of Scotland which lies near a port It used to be the headquarters headquarte r s of the Communism Union but broke down during the war Finding nothing could take the place of this splendid architecture people accomplished rebuilding it in It was to their credit that all furnished rooms are consistent with what they used to be My cousin was thrilled by its collections consisting of statues plus royal uniforms folded in glass tanks Though there was no possibility to buy some of these exhibits it was convenient to take photos which he sent me along with his fax An Air Crash I was a previous typist in a post office Because I couldn totlerate ty ping any more postage bills or postcodes on a typewriter every day I resigned With a greedy motivation of making big money I took up working as a business representative for the G E Ecology Company which produced goods by recycling useful materials from our dustbins My new job left me good impressions in many aspects except that the working timetable was full of traveling by jets Once when speeding up our jet was swallowed by a thunderstorm which destroyed our GPS receiver and made us lose sight of the directions A constantly flashing light showed that our jet was in danger A steward instantly asked us to put on masks and fasten the safety belts and then pressed a button to switch on the escaping capsule It slid sideways out of the opening at once and landed in a desert area safely Lacking food and tablets we were nervous and uncertain at first But we all kept optimistic and made good adjustment to the situation We swept up the surrounding mud to make our settlement and were back on our feet soon Finally guided by the smoke of our crashing jet some local citizens came by carriages and saved us G E GPS An Amateur Journalist Jane is a housewife but delighted to work as an amateur journalist It is a dilemma for her to rush between family and work and it is also unusual for the News Department to depend on an amateur to cover crimes But Jane is really gifted It is admirable that she is seldom accused of making mistakes And eager to become more professional she concentrates on her job and updates herself now and then Once she is informed of a new case her normal working process is as follows first she makes appointments with guilty people for interviews So as to acquire accurate stories she usually demands to record what they say Meanwhile a technically good colleague will assist her in taking photographs Second she assesses whether they are deliberately hiding the truth If she is skeptical about their words she will look into the case herself Third she writes thorough stories ahead of the deadline and submits it to the senior chief editor who polishes and approves every section Finally her stories will be published in different editions of their magazine First Aid A boy fell ill His organs were damaged by the radiation of an infrared ray stove But before the ambulance arrived a number of other injuries happened to this unlucky boy over and over again First he was choked by some poisonous liquid from the kettle on the cupboard Then his wrist skin was burnt by electric shock Finally his ankle was cut by a pan Fortunately the boy s nurse gave him proper temporary treatments according to his complex symptoms She mildly squeezedthe poisonous liquid out of his throat and put bandages firmly in place to apply pressure to the ankle wound to stop bleeding As for the burn she used scissors to remove his sleeve poured a basin of cold water over the burn to cool it and put her hands on a damp blouse to cover his swollen tissue tightly She also inspired his bravery to fight against the unbearable pain Her first aid made a vital difference in saving his life A ceremony was held to honour the nurse who overcame a variety of barriers to save the boy Abstract Art Abstract art used to be controversial On one hand the artists stopped painting delicate figures but attempted to adopt special techniques to give people different visual impacts On the other hand their works including sculptures carved out of marble or fragile clay were all with a specific aim of showing feelings Some conventional scholars who were allergic to abstract art said it was evidently ridiculous and neither art nor geometry Their Traditional Art Committee predicted its soon disappearing But nowadays abstract art has become part of the permanent possessionsof contemporary civilization Galleries along the Madison Avenue give scores of superb exhibitions on typical abstract works appealing to many who have a preference for abstract art The Shadow of Egypt a caf in this district has become the home to those aggressive abstract artists Consequently it is not a coincidence for you to meet one of these artists of great reputation in the flesh They are asked for signatures and given bunches of fragrant flowers plus they are given a great deal of praise by their faithful fans A Russian Poem Since childhood Anton had often recited poems accompanied by pianists and violinists at wedding ceremonies before brides and bridegrooms exchanged rings Gradually he found writing poems the most appropriate way to convey his joy and sorrow When his poem Contradictory Blank won him a national championship and a scholarship to the Moscow University from a sponsor he was just an unknown librarian After getting his diploma he devoted his life to writing poems Using concrete but flexible language and the minimum of words is his style He tried out different patterns and preferred nursery rhyme in particular The following is a translation of one of his works made up of sections Little sparrow with heavy load Ran out of energy and very cold No compass and all sweat salty Can you go through the endless darkness Little balloon let out by the thread Flew over cottages and was very glad With warmth transformed from sunlight He said he could forever fly Take it easy little balloon Don t tease the sparrow with his woun d On the bare branch and have a rest This diamond heart will eventually get success Let s Help Adolescents Whether they are male or female adolescentsfeel like deciding on everything themselves in spite of parents in s truction especially when they face problems like sex mental stress etc which make them feel ashamed and embarrassed Thus they often automatically get into troubles due to their imperfect comprehension and judgement Some are addicted to cigarettes only several packets of which will hurt their lungs and make them breathless quickly Others can qt uit drinking alcohol whose harmful effects include causing young pregnant women to abort or give birth to abnormal babies The worst is drug abuse for the withdrawal is tough once their bodies are accustomed to the drugs Meanwhile those who share needles bought from illegal chemists are at great risk of being infected with desperate AIDS If so neither injecting nor taking pills can guarantee their survival However don bt e disappointed at or have prejudice against our children so easily After all being awkward is an appendix of youth As long as we strengthen communication with them instead of only banning this or banning that we will surely help them avoid anything unfit Refresh Our Environment As the director stated on behalf of his researching group the data of this graph makes a clear presentation of the future environmental tendency On one hand the quantity of fuel keeps on decreasing by per year while the growth of a wide range of pollution has been a global trend On the other hand the mildly but steadily going up of the average temperature is resulting in catastropheslike widespread floods Without disagreement they subscribe to the view taht it is humans existence and their randomly consuming energy that result in this phenomenon Many people have a commitment that developing nuclear power or energy from outer space will stop bad consequencescoming about However scientists and educators are opposed to this view even if our needs may be met on the whole They tend to advocate refreshing our circumstances by saving energy and recycling waste It is suggested that we use energy saving appliances such as electrical motors microwaves and so on and not be casual about little things like recycling a can So please glance around and see what you can do So long as everybody makes contribution we will not have to put up with this problem anymore A Volcano Eruption As the best candidate I was appointed to collect and evaluate information for a database about diverse natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or thunderstorms Sometimes I did this by giving out questionnaires to those who went through them But sometimes I had to go through actual disasters myself The Musaki Volcano was one of them At that time I lived in a bungalow alongside the volcano with a novelist who came for the appreciation of its eruption One day when I was drawing diagrams on the balcony and he was bathing inside the volcano erupted unexpectedly The ash and lava fountains shooting highly in the sky varied from to meters in height It was absolutely fantastic I even noticed a rainbow appear in the fog caused by a heat wave But glancing through our surroundings I foresaw the potential danger and found no guarantee of our safety The uncomfortable gas almost made us unconscious Sweats of anxiety began to drop Managing to stop panicking and trembling we quickly put on our protective suits helmets and boots and eventually made our way to a safe place How lucky we were even though my precious equipment and documents were all burnt to the ground Musaki Defeat Disability Yang s ambition was to get an architect certificate or become a bowling master But when he was conducting experiments with a microscope in the basement a tank on the bench exploded sending him flying outwards through the exit He was out of breath while knowing he lost his eyesight as well as of his hearing In other words he was disabled Feeling clumsy he was annoyed at first though nobody made fun of him He cut out going outdoors and just sat around at home talking to his parrot or tortoise silently His sister resigned to help him in many ways Her assistance and encouragement were so beneficial to his psychology that he adapted to his disability soon and became outgoing again In a college accessible to him he studied politics and literature He always sat in the front row near the entry without any absence and with the help of his handy laptop he studied well by means of dictation His thesis Abolishing Slavery met with all professors a pp roval After class he and his companions often played drum music which was noisy but suitable for his hearing After graduation he made high profits by designing software for a firm All in all in his community he won his dignity and people s congratulations He always wished all the best to his disabled fellows and encouraged them Never mind All you have is adequate to get your achievement Happy Marriage Needs Fighting For As a talented navy officer he was bound to be busy When his wife rang him up to declare her divorce alarm he was still scanning a digital counter to check the data so as to give an assessment of the theoretical framework for a biochemical weapon His junior staff s sympathy made him feel embarrassed His wife was a part time clerk With his high bonus she lived in a grand house with elegant cushions and bedding Her favour was reading stars bio graphies or absurd fictions with endless chaptersin her armchair People envied her leisure life very much But in fact she was tired of being left alone She sent emails to his mailbox every week to state her thinking and ask for his accompaniment but never received reply of satisfaction Tired of his explanation that he must obey the orders she filed for divorce Because he desired to get their holy affection back he set other affairs aside He trimmed his fingernails short and changed his overweight figure as well as his awful haircut He wore an apron to prepare delicious cuisine for her He also bought her a necklace and piles of flowers hoping that their receiver could turn around After being tested out for months in all he eventually succeeded Mark and a Seal Mark rented an accommodation with his n near the shore He paid annual visits there to enjoy the vivid beauty in the depths of the pure sea Once with his underwater telescope and flashlight Mark dived along the boundary between the steep reef and the area of seaweed conservation Suddenly an awesome Antarctic seal with sharp teeth appeared opposite him Every cell in his body was scared to death But soon he was aware that he wasn the target of an attack With a neat wound in its lip caused by a shark this grey seal was washed upside down by the tides time after time But it tried to jog Mark as if to urge him to help it So Mark abandoned fleeing away With its teamwork Mark used a net to drag the seal to the shallow water Without pausing he helped it out after a simple operation and settled it in a narrow cave by the seaside Every time he brought it tasty fish it would yell and suck his hands happily Witnesses said their anecdotes reflected a magic dimension of the relationship between humans and animals Helping the Remote Village A year ago the famous astronaut received an invitation by airmail from a remote village Intending to sniff some fresh air he and his interpreter paid a fortnight visit there It was a privilege for them to be there but they were shocked by what they saw The tracks were muddy The river was drying up Most villagers only possessed one broom a few tins and several jars and their rectangular grass huts with round angles were surrounded by weeds Besides their school had no roof and platform and the students had no concept of clicking a computer at all They were badly in need Soon the astronaut made a generous voluntary donation to the village There were textbooks for students sewing machines for tailors and tractors for farmers His distribution catalogue also included operating a clinic and a trunk library as well as giving weekly lessons to teach relevant farming knowledge like how to dry out seeds or raise oxen He himself not only helped do some paperwork but also purchased grills for boys to toast potatoes and combs for girls who were dying to get one The other day he heard from the villagers again inviting him to participate in the donation anniversary For political and security reasons he couldn atdjust his outgoing arrangement otherwise he would go But his deeds were remembered forever Study in America Nannan fsather runs an enterprise near the Ming Tombs selling batteries and drills to the Daqing Oilfield Hoping to get the qualification to help govern it Nannan made much preparation and then left her motherland with her visa to study in America Having reached her destination she settled in an inn recommended by the travel agent As far as Nannan was concerned she always kept it up in China But she had to acknowledge it was not easy to adjust herself to the new academic requirements which were not parallel with China sT hough she was occupied with lectures and seminars day in and day out the essays she drafted were still contradicted by her tutors As for her routine life she felt that it was hard to fit in too For example she found English idioms difficult to understand And it was out of the question to eat delicious Chinese foods though many optional cafeterias served abundant substitutes In addition she had to wait in a queue early for the minibus that took her to school and it was usually so cold that she felt numb What bothered her most was that she received no apology when her sleeping was disturbed by a barking dog in a shopkeeper s cage Luckily with her parents comforting her by videophone she became autonomous soon and eventually got hebr achelor s degree successfully Immigrate to America Attracted by the boom in America my nephew teamed up with a Korean to illegally cross the Bearing Strait in the Arctic to America To avoid the Customs punishment they hid in a small ferry called the North Pole Seagull sitting back to back without sleeping showering and shaving for days and had no chance to mourn their lost luggage when landing The hardship of this crossing was apparent At first he made a living by means of raising cattle and then was hired in aircraft industries He lived in a Catholic district Taking in a small percentage of Pakistani immigrants the majority of the residents were from Italy and Denmark who all kept up their customs and cultures Different blocks here were distinctly marked out and indicated from the racial angle It was unfair and needed reforming But with nowhere else to go my nephew lived on and managed to make a life for himself My nephew s fortune came when he bravely helped a conductor brake a ream to stop it from slipping out of the rails The man was elected vice chairman of the Socialist Party later It occurred to my nephew that he could grasp this opportunity to ask for his help The man who was thankful helped him apply to the civil authority for the right to live in America by inserting his brave deed into his documents Unlike a great many other applicants his application was approved by the Federal Justice Ministry Before long he started his own bakery and lived a better life Be Careful about Cloning After a series of initial experiments and corrections the scientist h ards work paid off when the twin clone turkeys were hatched with normal feather and claws This breakthrough possibly enabled people to bring their adored pets back to life However it bothered him from time to time that their health was in poor condition because they were unable to resist illnesses This drawback cast him down Merely weeks later the clones and their carrier died which struck frustration into his heart He retired before he attained his ambition and became a member of an opera chorus to relieve his depression Shortly afterwards the media published a conservative argument objecting to cloning owing to moral problems and suggested the constitution include compulsory regulations to forbid obtaining commercial profits from cloning When interviewed the scientist stared at the decorations on the ceiling thinking for a while and then said I nmot in favour of any arbitrary assumption but undertaking cloning does differ from the straightforward procedure of making loafs out of flour Until we accumulate enough exact knowledge any practice is in vain and is bound to fail Altogether being more careful is reasonable or we may walk into a side road Strange Patent Applications I set about working in the current Patent Office after resigning from the court personnel Competent and dynamic I never feel passive while diving into the identifications of whether applications are valid and practical according to the new version of the criteria With the expectation of distinguishing their own importance some people leave the beaten track and file strange products with us now and then for example lantern that can be attached on your forehead cubic walnuts refrigerator made of straw and glue perfume that nobody can bear to smell and so on Once a man made a triangle helicopter out of stainless wires and string He called us up and merrily claimed it was stable and convenient to use and never out of order I asked him to hang on but this innocent man just rang off and set out to fly from his courtyard I dialed his number in the directory trying to ring him back but never got through Merciful God blessing an abrupt freezing rainfall made his powder wet Luckily the trouble was without any extension except that he crashed into a greengrocer s making all the ripe fruits become messy jam When people seized this crazy man with caution and sobered him by tapping his face he complained about the bad weather instead of associating his failure with his unscientific design Pronunciation and Status An ambassadorand a referee were consulting a professor on the caption of a Buddhistic alphabet when a sobbing woman stopped them to sell an antique musical bathtub Her dirty garment and the handkerchief around her waist were badly in need of sending to a laundry The ambassador uncomfortably gave her a handful of pence from his wallet and said Take this fortune away troublesome woman When her figure faded away the brilliant professor said You are mistaken an your improper remark on her should be condemned In terms of this extraordinary woman you can t classify her status by her horrible clothes or disgusting nails Her clean woolen vest and stockings especially her classic pronunciation all suggested her upper status The ambassador gaveleainwhaimstazement and advised making her acquaintance The professor hesitated for a while then compromised The outcome was that she was an authentic superior police officer When they were shown in her office and saw her once more she brought them a teapot of tea and some cookies laughing and saying I rubbed some cream and wax on my garment and passed myself off as a shabby woman among thieves and robbers to investigate a plot Generally speaking your overlooking me and my adaptation are the best help But my pronunciation seemed to have betrayed me A Sly Murder When giving a lecture about the significance of punctuation the academic professor was
